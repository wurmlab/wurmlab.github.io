## Abstract
<hr />

In species with social hierarchies, the death of dominant individuals typically upheaves the social hierarchy and provides an opportunity for subordinate individuals to become reproductives. Such a phenomenon occurs in the monogyne form of the fire ant, *Solenopsis invicta*, where colonies typically contain a single wingless reproductive queen, thousands of workers and hundreds of winged nonreproductive virgin queens. Upon the death of the mother queen, many virgin queens shed their wings and initiate reproductive development instead of departing on a mating flight. Workers progressively execute almost all of them over the following weeks. To identify the molecular changes that occur in virgin queens as they perceive the loss of their mother queen and begin to compete for reproductive dominance, we collected virgin queens before the loss of their mother queen, 6 h after orphaning and 24 h after orphaning. Their RNA was extracted and hybridized against microarrays to examine the expression levels of approximately 10000 genes. We identified 297 genes that were consistently differentially expressed after orphaning. These include genes that are putatively involved in the signalling and onset of reproductive development, as well as genes underlying major physiological changes in the young queens.

**Table S1** List and annotations of all fire ant genes significantly upregulated for at least one of the following comparisons: 6h vs 0h, 24h vs 6h, 24h vs 0h. Some genes are significant according to multiple microarray clones

**Table S2** List and annotations of all fire ant genes significantly downregulated for at least one of the following comparisons: 6h vs 0h, 24h vs 6h, 24h vs 0h. Some genes are significant according to multiple microarray clones

**Table S3** List and annotations of all fire ant genes significantly upregulated for at least one of the following comparisons: 6h vs 0h, 24h vs 6h, 24h vs 0h and also significantly higher in brains of honey bee queens than reproductive workers

**Table S4** List and annotations of all fire ant genes significantly upregulated for at least one of the following comparisons: 6h vs 0h, 24h vs 6h, 24h vs 0h and also significantly upregulated after mating in honey bee queens

**Table S5** List and annotations of all fire ant genes significantly upregulated for at least one of the following comparisons: 6h vs 0h, 24h vs 6h, 24h vs 0h and also significantly upregulated ins *Anopheles gambiae* females in response to mating according to ectorbase gene expression data

**Fig. S1** Graphical representation of microarray hybridizations. The unit of biological replication is the colony; each pool of five queens was hybridized to two different microarrays. Each vertice represents an amplified RNA sample and each edge represents a microarray hybridization (a total of 3*8=24 hybridizations were conducted). Cy3-labeled samples are at the tails and Cy5-labeled samples are at the heads of arrows.

**Data S1** Genepix GPR files and normalized log2 (Cy5/Cy3) ratios are found in the Gene Expression Omnibus database <span class="info-text">[5]</span> under accession number GSE19721.
