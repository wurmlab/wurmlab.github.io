<hr />

Ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) represent one of the most successful eusocial taxa in terms of both their geographic distribution and species number. The publication of seven ant genomes within the past year was a quantum leap for socio- and ant genomics. The diversity of social organization in ants makes them excellent model organisms to study the evolution of social systems. Comparing the ant genomes with those of the honeybee, a lineage that evolved eusociality independently from ants, and solitary insects suggests that there are significant differences in key aspects of genome organization between social and solitary insects, as well as among ant species. Altogether, these seven ant genomes open exciting new research avenues and opportunities for understanding the genetic basis and regulation of social species, and adaptive complex systems in general.

## Glossary
<hr />

**Caste** <br />
a subset of individuals in an insect colony that are characterized either behaviorally or morphologically.

**Environmental caste determination (ECD)** <br />
the differentiation between queens and worker castes is determined by environmental factors, such as exposure to hormones, temperature, or alternate food sources. This is thought to be the main mechanism of caste determination across eusocial species.

**Epigenetics** <br />
the study of heritable molecular differences resulting in a measurable phenotype that result from DNA methylation or chromatin modification, such as histone methylation, rather than alterations in the DNA sequence itself.

**Eusociality** <br />
a form of social organization found in all ants (as well as some other insects, crustaceans and vertebrates) that is typified by a reproductive division of labor (i.e. queens and workers), overlapping generations and cooperative care of young.

**Gamergate** <br />
in ant species, such as *Harpegnathos saltator*, a worker ant may mate and become fully reproductively active (i.e. queen like); that is, it can produce female and male offspring. Such a reproductive worker is called a gamergate.

**Genetic caste determination (GCD)** <br />
reproductive caste is determined by intrinsic (genetic) factors acting upstream of environmental differences. For example, in some harvester ants, when queens of a lineage mate with males of the same lineage, a reproductive queen is produced. When queens mate with males of another lineage, workers are produced. Without mating occurring between both lineages, a colony cannot produce both workers and new queens.

**Haplodiploid sex determination** <br />
a sex-determination system where unfertilized, haploid eggs develop into fertile males and diploid, fertilized eggs develop into females. One consequence of this system is that males normally have no father and cannot give rise to sons. Hymenoptera have a haplodiploid sex-determination system.

**Hymenoptera** <br />
a large order of insects that have four transparent wings; it includes the bees, wasps, ants and sawflies. Females often have a sting.

**Monandry** <br />
a pattern of mating in which a female animal mates with only one male.

**Monogyny** <br />
in social insects, this refers to a social organization where there is a single reproductive female per colony (in contrast to the mating system bearing the same name).

**Monomorphic** <br />
in social insects, this refers to workers that have the same overall body size, mass and morphology.

**Polyandry** <br />
a pattern of mating in which a female animal mates with more than one male.

**Polygyny** <br />
in social insects, this refers to a social organization where there are multiple reproductive females per colony (in contrast to the mating system bearing the same name).

**Sociogenesis** <br />
the origin of social organization that derives from past interaction experiences.

**Trophallaxis** <br />
transfer of liquid food between members of a social insect colony. The liquid food that is transferred has typically been stored in the crop or proventriculus of workers.

**Unicoloniality** <br />
a social structure of ants in which the workers can move freely between different nests and do not show aggression toward non-nest mate workers, often because genetic variation is sufficiently low that individuals cannot distinguish ‘foreign’ colonies from their own.
