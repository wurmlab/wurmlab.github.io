 - automated and manual gene prediction
 - visualisation of -omic data
 - correct and incorrect interpretation of -omic data
 - tradeoffs in molecular and bioinformatics approaches (speed, cost, etc)
 - caveats of different data types and algorithms
 - robust, reproducible and reliable analysis code

References, and example projects available upon request. We have done consultancy work for the private sector (human population or disease genomics) and public sector (ecological & evolutionary questions & data).
