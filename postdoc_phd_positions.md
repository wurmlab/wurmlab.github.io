# Joining the lab

We are always eager for smart & motivated people to come and work with us. The [Organismal Biology department](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk) at QMUL includes many other behavioral and evolutionary genomics researchers; we share a cutting edge laboratory for genomics work and a powerful computing environment. [We are located](/map) in East London, with many of us living locally (Hackney, Bow) - a 15 minute walk to 20 minute bicycle ride from the office.

If you're interested in joining us, please provide by email a CV, and a short proposal. Projects should address major evolutionary or ecologically relevant questions, and/or major challenges in bioinformatics/genomics. We are happy for projects to include population genomics, comparative analyses, bioinformatics, molecular biology, software development, hacking, field or behavioral work.



## Postdocs

**2022-08-30: We have an open 18-month postdoc position (potential for extension). Topic: evolutionary genomics / pollinator health (some flexibility in details). Email us with a CV for more information. Official ad will be online soon. Partial remote work possible if its in the UK. Part time possible. Pay 34,000 - 46,000 per year pro rata depending on experience.**

We invite applications for fellowships (Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie & Royal Society). The biggest effort is usually to come up with a good project. Once a proposal is written it is often worth applying to several funding sources.

These can include:
 * many national sources of funding (e.g., [Swiss NSF](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx), [Fondation Fyssen](http://www.fondationfyssen.fr/), [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/))
 * [EMBO](http://www.embo.org/funding-awards)
 * putting together a [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/) or [NERC](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/) grant with you as a named researcher co-investigator
 * [FEBS](http://www.febs.org/)

## PhD positions

**2022-08-30: We have an open "UK-fees" PhD position. Apply by 2022-09-15 with a CV and cover letter. This covers UK stipend and "UK home fees" to the university. It does not cover international fees.**

PhD funding normally exists as part of multiple schemes. These include:

 * RCUK Doctoral training programmes - application deadlines in January. The two programmes are slightly different, in that NERC is typically more for ecology &amp; evolution type questions, while BBSRC has historically been more mechanistic. However, the boundary is very fuzzy - it can be relevant to apply to both. These programmes are accessible to UK residents and to EU citizens.
    * [London NERC Doctoral Training Programme](http://london-nerc-dtp.org)
    * [BBSRC London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme](http://lido-dtp.ac.uk)

 * Many national schemes exist (e.g., from your country of origin). Some of these are listed [on QMUL's page](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/index.html) including:
    * CONACYT (Mexico)
    * Colfuturo (Colombia) provide 2 years of funding and we can potentially figure out the rest.
    * Commonwealth Scholarships
    * Newton fund (e.g., [Newton-Bhabha](https://www.britishcouncil.in/programmes/higher-education/newton-fund))
	* [Commonwealth scholarships  for high income countries (Canada, Australia, Trinidad...)](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-high-income-countries/)
	* US citizens can come with [Marshall](http://www.marshallscholarship.org/applications/eligible) or [Fullbright](http://www.fulbright.org.uk/going-to-the-uk/postgraduate-student-awards) scholarships.
 * Occasionally, we have specific funding for PhD positions.
 * In some circumstances we accept self-funded PhD candidates.

Please get in touch if you want to apply for a PhD position.

## Internships

We can in some cases host interns (for French students: par exemple pour les stages de M2 ou Ã©quivalent).
This is much easier if you come with your own funding. Minimal duration is 5 months.

## MSc students

Our department hosts at least 3 MSc progams that are relevant to our research - these programs typically last one year for full-time students, include taught courses and a 6-9 month research project.

 * [Bioinformatics MSc program](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/masters/courses/169225.html)
 * [Evolutionary Genomics MSc program](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/masters/courses/169221.html)
 * [Ecology and Evolution MSc program](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/masters/courses/169220.html)
