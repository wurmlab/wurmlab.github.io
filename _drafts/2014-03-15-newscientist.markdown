* Please respect the style guidelines given by <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/020530902X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=020530902X&linkCode=as2&tag=yannickwurm-21">Strunk & White's "The Elements of Style"</a>.  Keep it concise. 
* Use a spell-checker and a grammar-checker (on strict mode!).
* Eliminate the information the reader may not care about (e.g. unrelated or highly technical info). Say it in simple words
* Simplify or eliminate information that is too technical for the generalist reader. 
* Consider carefully: what is boring? what is sexy? what is necessary? what can be simplified? 
* Catchy title? 
* What does the first paragraph do?
