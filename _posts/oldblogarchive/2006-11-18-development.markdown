    [![excellgene.com preview](http://yannick.poulet.org/dev/projects/xlgSmall.gif)](http://yannick.poulet.org/dev/projects/xlg.gif) ExcellGene is a recent biotech spin-off from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](http://www.epfl.ch), Lausanne. They have some very exciting protein production technology. I designed and implemented and maintain their [internet presence](http://www.excellgene.com).

    [![preview](http://yannick.poulet.org/dev/projects/danielefrabouletSmall.gif)](http://yannick.poulet.org/dev/projects/danielefraboulet.png)A great French aquarelle painter's web site. She happens to be my mom as well! The challenge in making [this site](http://www.danielefraboulet.com) is that it needed to be distributable in a stand-alone version, ie. on CD-ROM without internet connection or sql-server. Javascript isn't supported by not-so-recent browsers, so I ended up using some perl scripts, some XML files (describing the paintings) and used the project as an excuse for learning XSL (to transform the data into static x-html). For the online-version, several php-forms were added.



## School-related projects




Bebetes Project
    Along with 5 others...

Projet Regulation
    Ok. This isn't code. But Am,ao?(C)lie V,ao?(C)ron and I spent a lot of time on the computer for it! It's an attempt at modeling part of _E. coli_'s global regulation, using a tool called [Genetic Network Analyzer](http://www.inrialpes.fr/helix/logic_GNA_mn.html), developed at Helix Inria. We did this as part of a fourth-year project at Insa de Lyon. (more info in the pdf file's intro). [This is it](http://yannick.poulet.org/dev/gna2003.pdf).
[Timepark](http://yannick.poulet.org/development/timepark)
    2003-2004 first semester project: an edo-based modeling framework (C++) and graphical end-user app (Obj-C).
