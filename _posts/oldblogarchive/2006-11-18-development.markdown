## Personal Projects




[cocoadevcentral.plugin](/attic/dev/cocoadevcentral.plugin)
    A plug-in for [Inferiis' MacReporter](http://www.inferiis.com/products/macreporter) and [Cocoadevcentral.com](http://www.cocoadevcentral.com)
timeSaver
    A screensaver for MacOS X. Because knowing what time it is can help.
iConvert Images
    A droplet for MacOS X. Based on imageMagick, it lets you convert image files to and from a **huge** number of image formats
[excellgene.com](http://www.excellgene.com)
    [![excellgene.com preview](/attic/dev/projects/xlgSmall.gif)](/attic/dev/projects/xlg.gif) ExcellGene is a recent biotech spin-off from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](http://www.epfl.ch), Lausanne. They have some very exciting protein production technology. I designed and implemented and maintain their [internet presence](http://www.excellgene.com).

    [![preview](/attic/dev/projects/danielefrabouletSmall.gif)](/attic/dev/projects/danielefraboulet.png)A great French aquarelle painter's web site. She happens to be my mom as well! The challenge in making [this site](http://www.danielefraboulet.com) is that it needed to be distributable in a stand-alone version, ie. on CD-ROM without internet connection or sql-server. Javascript isn't supported by not-so-recent browsers, so I ended up using some perl scripts, some XML files (describing the paintings) and used the project as an excuse for learning XSL (to transform the data into static x-html). For the online-version, several php-forms were added.



## School-related projects




Bebetes Project
    Along with 5 others...
Les Fourmis

Projet Regulation
    Ok. This isn't code. But Am,ao?(C)lie V,ao?(C)ron and I spent a lot of time on the computer for it! It's an attempt at modeling part of _E. coli_'s global regulation, using a tool called Genetic Network Analyzer, developed at Helix Inria. We did this as part of a fourth-year project at Insa de Lyon. (more info in the pdf file's intro). [This is it](/attic/dev/gna2003.pdf).
[Timepark](/attic/dev/timepark)
    2003-2004 first semester project: an edo-based modeling framework (C++) and graphical end-user app (Obj-C).
