## Timepark


Development report (for my school, Insa de Lyon).









## Timepark


Timepark pre-alpha development preview. This software is neither stable nor polished, it is merely a proof of feasibility prototype. [Download](http://yannick.poulet.org/dev/TimePark.zip) for Mac OS X 10.3.









## Timepark framework


An open source modeling and simulation framework, used as the backend for Timepark. Permits object-oriented modeling of dynamic systems.




  * An object's position is defined by it's (x,y,z) properties; object classes may inherit these and additionally defined properties.


  * A property's value can be defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs).


  * A property can evolve differently depending on the system's state through the use of control statements which are functions of any of the system's objects properties (eg: if _light is green_ then _d(x)/dt = 10_ else _d(x)/dt =0_.


Technologies: C++ STL, Flex/Yacc, Xerces, OpenGL
