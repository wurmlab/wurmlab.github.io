[Red Fire Ants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Imported_Fire_Ant) are natives of South America where they occupy an ecologic niche, under pressure of predators and competitors. In other places, such as the southern [United States](http://www.invasivespecies.gov/profiles/fireant.shtml) or [Australia](http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/fireants/), fire ants are considered an _invasive species_: given almost no predators or competitors, their proliferation is unlimited. They have become a considerable agricultural and thus **economic pest** as well as a significant **health hazard**.

Understanding these guys could contribute to solving these issues. It might also help understand how a useful social insect, the honey bee, works. We could get **better honey**!

Other issues which could be of interest for ants as well as generally concerning how life and evolution work include:



	
  * Eggs laid by a queen are practically identical. How does the environment (temperature variations...) and handling (by nurses) determine that a larvae will become a queen while another will become a worker? Which worker will become a soldier? a nurse? a scout?

	
  * A queen can live a long time - maybe 20 or 40 years. But a worker's life lasts only one or two years. And a male only one or two weeks. And yet they carry identical genetic information. Could we also live longer?

	
  * How do ants form alliances with other colonies? How do they use slavery, propaganda, deception, appeasement, spying? How does an individual know what it should do and communicate the result?

	
  * To which extent is it possible to use ideas from social insects to solve our problems? A large number of cooperating small interchangeable robots might solve certain issues better than one big robot...

	
  * ...


Lastly, ants appear to form the **ideal communist society**:

"In our view, the competitive edge that led to the rise of the ants as a world-dominant group is their highly developed, self-sacrificial colonial existence. It would appear that socialism really works under some circumstances. Karl Marx just had the wrong species."
