Had a great two weeks visiting John Wang's lab at Academia Sinica, Taiwan, and join National Taiwan University's [International Symposium on Social Insects](http://twentomolsoc.blogspot.com/2011/03/international-symposium-on-social.html) for wonderfully stimulating talks by [Jo Billen](http://bio.kuleuven.be/ento/), [Lars Chittka](http://chittkalab.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/), [James Nieh,](http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/labs/nieh/) Kenji Matsuura & [Bob Vander Meer](http://ars.usda.gov/pandp/people/people.htm?personid=5796). The symposium gave me the opportunity to share some thoughts about [sequencing genomes with high throughput technologies](http://yannick.poulet.org/publications/wurm2011antGenomeBehindTheScenes.pdf) in the journal of the Taiwan Entomological Society, Formosan Entomologist.

In genomic news, the _Acromyrmex echinatior _leafcutter ant genome, led by Sanne Nygaard & Koos Boosma is _in press_!  The data are already on [Fourmidable](http://www.antgenomes.org); and Fourmdiable's [ant genome BLAST interface](http://www.antgenomes.org) was updated to the latest [SequenceServer](http://www.sequenceserver.com).
