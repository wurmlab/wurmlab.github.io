Current or former students *very regularly* ask me for a reference to help them apply for a job or a new study program. The process is facilitated & the letter is improved by the following advice. 

If you need a reference letter from me, I need you to write a first draft. First, you are best positioned to know what makes you great for what you're applying for. Second, you'll end up with a better letter if my time is spent revising something than if I try to create something from scratch. 

Your draft should in the form of a letter from me about you (yes, it can feel awkward to write like this). You basically need to say that you are a great and justify why). Some general tips: 

* Please respect the style guidelines given by <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/020530902X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=020530902X&linkCode=as2&tag=yannickwurm-21">Strunk & White's "The Elements of Style"</a>.  Keep it concise. 
* Use a spell-checker and a grammar-checker (on strict mode!).
* It's better if the examples you use are relevant to the degree you're applying to.
* Don't highlight weaknesses. E.g. if you have a "C" in something don't mention it. 
* Whatever you do, don't lie. Any lies will come back to hurt you 1000-fold (karma). 
* Send it as a document I can edit (not a PDF).


### Structure 

Introductory paragraph. This should include: 

 * Why I am writing
 * Why I know you well (e.g., I am your academic advisor/tutor/supervisor/lecturer since at Queen Mary since xxx when you started your degree in XX). 
 * Which degree you are doing and when you are expected to graduate. 
 * The last sentence should be a small list of ideas (see below), summarizing why you are great for the opportunity you're applying to. This also announces the structure of the subsequent pre-conclusion paragraphs (i.e., it should end with a list of 2 or 3 or 4 items as below). 


One paragraph per idea (no ping-ponging back and forth!). Some examples of ideas: 

 * academic achievements (e.g., coursework or overall grades, predicted final grade ("first?"))
 * evidence that you are dedicated/serious/hardworking/intelligent/creative (e.g., based on your project, punctuality, behavior in tutorials). 
 * evidence that you have a good personality (e.g., social intelligence, teamwork, helping others). 
 * extra-curricular activities (jobs, volunteering)

Conclusion: a quick summary stating that you're great for the degree/program/job because of the 3 or 4 ideas. 

Overall, the reference should not take more than 1 page - people are unlikely to read anything that is longer.
