Our paper on the genetic diversity of the fire ant social chromosomes has been accepted in Molecular Ecology and is now available [online](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.14054/full)!

The fire ant social chromosomes carry a supergene that controls the number of queens in a colony. We describe a few features of this supergene system:
* The two variants of the social chromosomes are differentiated from each other over the supergene region, but without any evidence of evolutionary strata.
* There is a large number non-synonymous substitutions between the two variants.
* The never recombining variant Sb is almost fixed in the North American population.

You can check out the press release, which covers some of the details about our work.
