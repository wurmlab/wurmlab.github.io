This work should significantly facilitate the interpretation of results produced with our Sequenceserver custom BLAST-ing tool (see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/033142"><emph>Sequenceserver: a modern graphical user interface for custom BLAST databases</emph>; Priyam et al. 2015 BioRxiv</a>). This project is part of the [Open Genome Informatics](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6212058194378752/) organization; supervision by [Priyam](/team/priyam/) & Yannick.
 
 * <a href="http://www.jmazz.me/">Julian Mazzitelli</a> (U Toronto) will improve <a href="http://bionode.io">Bionode</a>'s capabilities for performing **analyses of streams of biological data** in real-time as they are downloaded, computed, or generated. This project is part of the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5693436329984000/); supervision by [Bruno Vieira](/team/bmpvieira.html), [Max Ogden](http://maxogden.com/), [Mathias Buus](https://github.com/mafintosh) & Yannick.
