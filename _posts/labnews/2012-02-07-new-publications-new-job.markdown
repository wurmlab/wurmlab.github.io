New year, new country, new job:  I am now a [Lecturer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer#United_Kingdom) at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/). I will continue to use genomics and bioinformatics approaches to examine the interplay between social evolution and genome evolution. Get in touch if you're interested in working with me in a great place.

And a few nice papers on which I am coauthor are now out.




  * [PNAS: Relaxed selection is a precursor to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity](http://yannick.poulet.org/publications/hunt2011phenotypicPlasticity.pdf). Led by Brendan Hunt at Georgia Tech


  * [Bioinformatics: Visualization and quality assessment of de novo genome assemblies](http://yannick.poulet.org/publications/Bioinformatics-2011-Riba-Grognuz-3425-6.pdf) - led by [Oksana Riba-Grognuz](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unil.ch%2Fdee%2Fpage81073_en.html&ei=fRcxT9HTMMi_0QWrhNSzBw&usg=AFQjCNE8Ei6RfZ8mIpMA03zncpmkodTzbg&sig2=7AxdNSLp5YWPl93zXvcf5Q) - [Source code available](https://github.com/ksanao/TGNet).


  * [Trends in Genetics: The genomic impact of 100 million years of social evolution in seven ant species](http://yannick.poulet.org/publications/TiG2011.pdf). Reviews some of the findings from the [ant genome projects](http://www.antgenomes.org) & lays the foundation for coming analyses. Romain Libbrecht & I made the photo that was selected as cover image!
