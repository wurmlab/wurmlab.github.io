New year, new country, new job:  I am now a [Lecturer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer#United_Kingdom) at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/). I will continue to use genomics and bioinformatics approaches to examine the interplay between social evolution and genome evolution. Get in touch if you're interested in working with me in a great place.

And a few nice papers on which I am coauthor are now out.

  * [Trends in Genetics: The genomic impact of 100 million years of social evolution in seven ant species](http://yannick.poulet.org/publications/TiG2011.pdf). Reviews some of the findings from the [ant genome projects](http://www.antgenomes.org) & lays the foundation for coming analyses.
