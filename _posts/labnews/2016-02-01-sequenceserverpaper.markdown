Happy to announce that we now have a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/033142">manuscript describing the rationale and current features of SequenceServer</a> - our easy to setup <a href="http://sequenceserver.com">BLAST frontend</a>. Importantly, the manuscript also provides extensive detail about the sustainable software development and user-centric design approaches we used to build this software. The full bioRxiv reference is:

<p><b>Sequenceserver: a modern graphical user interface for custom BLAST databases</b> 2015. Priyam, Woodcroft, Rai, Munagala, Moghul, Ter, Gibbins, Moon, Leonard, Rumpf and Wurm. <a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/033142"><em>bioRxiv doi: 10.1101/033142</em> <b>[PDF]</b></a>.</p>

Be sure to check out the interactive figure giving <a href="http://www.sequenceserver.com/paper/fig2interactive/"> a guided tour of Sequenceserver's BLAST results</a>.

Finally, I'll note that Sequenceserver arose from our own needs; these are clearly shared by many as Sequenceserver has already been cited in <a href="http://www.sequenceserver.com/#users">&ge;20 publications</a> and has been <a href="http://biogems.info/">downloaded &ge;30,000 times</a>! Thanks to all community members who have made this tool successful.
