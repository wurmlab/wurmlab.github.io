<h4 style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Scientists from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) have
discovered that the chromosome responsible for the social
organisation of colonies of the highly invasive fire ant is likely
to have evolved via a single event rather than over time.</strong></h4>




<p>Red fire ants are found in two different types of colonies: some
colonies have a single queen while other colonies contain dozens of
queens. The team had previously discovered that colony type is
determined by a chromosome that carries one of two variants of a
‘supergene’ region containing more than 500 genes.</p>
<p>In a new research paper, published in the journal <em>Molecular Ecology</em>, the team from QMUL’s <a href=
"http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/">School of Biological and Chemical
Sciences</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14054">sequenced the DNA and compared the genomes of two
types of individuals: those carrying the supergene version</a>
responsible for colonies with a single queen, and those carrying
the supergene variant responsible for colonies with multiple
queens.</p>
<p>“We found that the two versions of the chromosome differ
homogeneously over the entire length of the supergene. This
suggests that a single event, such as a large chromosomal
rearrangement, was responsible for the origin of this remarkable
system for determining social organisation,” said lead author

Yannick Wurm</a> from QMUL’s <a href=

Sciences</a>.</p>
<h3>Evolutionary advantage?</h3>
<p>The team also discovered a large number of unfavourable
mutations in the version of the supergene responsible for colonies
with multiple queens.</p>
<p>Dr Wurm added: “It is likely that only a few genes among the
hundreds present in the supergene region are responsible for
differences in social organisation. Our finding indicates that the
advantages of having several queens in the colony outweigh the
costs of the unfavourable mutations in the supergene region.”</p>
<p>This finding can help scientists understand how chromosomes
evolve over time.</p>

"http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/staff/rodrigopracana.html">Rodrigo
Pracana</a>, a PhD student at QMUL and first author of the study,
said: “We know that the Y chromosome in mammals has also been
affected by unfavourable mutations. It is exciting to see that the
fire ant social chromosome has evolved in a similar way to the
human Y chromosome, although it controls social organisation and
not sex.”</p>
<h3>A real pest</h3>
<p>The red fire ant, which is a native species in South America, is
infamous for its painful sting, and is known in many other parts of
the world where its aggressiveness and high population density have
made it an invasive pest. It was accidentally introduced to the
southern USA in the 1930s and has since spread to many warm parts
of the world including in China and Australia. Efforts at
controlling the spread of this species have largely been
unsuccessful, as indicated by its Latin name, Solenopsis invicta,
meaning “the invincible”.</p>
<p>Rodrigo Pracana added: “Our discoveries could help to develop
novel pest control strategies. For example, a pesticide that
disrupts the social organisation in this species without affecting
other species would be beneficial.<br>
“This might be achieved by targeting the genes in the supergene
region. We find almost no genetic diversity in the version of the
supergene specific to colonies with multiple queens so targeting
genes in this region means there would be limited potential for the
ants to evolve resistance.”</p>
