Many interesting talks and stimulating discussions during [Shenzhen's Social Insect Genomics Conference](http://ldl.genomics.org.cn/event/conference.jsp?conId=31) which coincided with the release of Sanne Nygaard's [_Acromyrmex echinatior_ leaf-cutter ant genome paper](http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.121392.111) showing adaptations linked to fungal farming. More excitement is on its way with next generation sociogenetics projects bubbling up around the world & across the phylogeny!
