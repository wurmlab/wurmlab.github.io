Google summer of code 2016 has just came to an end. Thanks to our host organisations [Open Genome Informatics](//summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6212058194378752/) and [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](//www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page), we've had a productive summer with two excellent students. Both students wrote blog posts summarizing their work.

 * <a href="//github.com/aniarya82">Hiten Chowdhary</a> created novel BLAST result visualization methods for [SequenceServer](//www.sequenceserver.com). He wrote an [overview of his work](/news/2016-08-23-hiten-blast-visualization-gsoc).

 * After reviewing in detail the [strengths and weaknesses of bash, make, snakemake and nextflow as biological analysis pipelines](//github.com/thejmazz/jmazz.me/blob/master/content/post/ngs-workflow.md), [Julian Mazzitelli](//www.jmazz.me) created [Bionode waterwheel](//github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill), a tool demonstrating the capabilities of javascript streams for real-time analysis of biological data.

As the finishing touches are implemented, we look forward to being able to deploy the work of these students into production releases of [SequenceServer](//www.sequenceserver.com) and [Bionode](//bionode.io).
